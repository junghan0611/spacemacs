Description
===========

This layer makes your Emacs sound like an IBM Selectric typewriter, for
those moments when your loud, clicky mechanical keyboard is not at hand,
yet, you'd still wish to enjoy the sound.

Features:
---------

-   Brings back fond memories about your first programming job where you
    started with that big mechanical keyboard and the small monochrome
    display working on the latest IBM Iseries server.

Install
=======

To use this configuration layer, add it to your `~/.spacemacs`. You will
need to add `selectric` to the existing
`dotspacemacs-configuration-layers` list in this file.
